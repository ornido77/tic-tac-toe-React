Tic Tac Toe Web App

Project Structure

In this project, there is only one page consisting of H1, p, span, table, button html elements and designed using CSS.
Which the table is consist of 3(column) by 3(row) grid and each of the grid being a React Component to easily change it's state using react hooks. And as each of the grid state changes there is function running to check all the possibe combination to check if there is a winner, if there is a winner it will be shown as well as a restart button, if there is no winner just click the button reset.

Development environment instructions

I use VS code as my IDE and GitHub to commit all my codes on a remote repository. Any browser will work but Chrome is recommended.

Execution instructions

You can simply download or clone the source code in my github account.
And do an npm install command to download all dependencies and npm start to start the server.
Or go to https://ornido77.github.io/tic-tac-toe-React/ as I hosted it to github pages.

My comment

In this project, I decided to only use React JS because I don't have any idea about TypeScript and I don't need NodeJS as what I am building is a simple web app that lets 2 players play at the same computer. And because of that I thought that React hooks is enough, and adding NodeJS backend will make it more complicated and will make the development longer.

SO I think adding NodeJS in the future will make the solution better to make the app a multiplayer game which stores a realtime score and make a chatbox.
